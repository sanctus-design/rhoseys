            “I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been
            looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an
            amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and
            found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12
            weeks was the best — and most grueling — time of my life. Since
            completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working
            as a Software Engineer at a VR startup.”

            “Before joining the bootcamp, I’d never written a line of code. I
            needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
            programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
            student who could only say wonderful things about the program. The
            curriculum and staff did not disappoint — they were hands-on, and I
            never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project was
            outstanding and helped me land a job as a full-stack developer.”
